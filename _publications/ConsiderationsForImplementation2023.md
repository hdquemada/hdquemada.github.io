Gene drive-modified mosquitoes
(GDMMs) are being developed as possible new tools to prevent transmission of malaria and other mosquito-borne diseases. To date no GDMMs have yet
undergone field testing. This early stage is an opportune time for developers, supporters, and possible
users to begin to consider the potential regulatory
requirements for eventual implementation of these
technologies in national or regional public health
programs, especially as some of the practical implications of these requirements may take considerable
planning, time and coordination to address. Several
currently unresolved regulatory questions pertinent
to the implementation of GDMMs are examined,
including: how the product will be defined; what
the registration/approval process will be for placing
new GDMM products on the market; how the potential for transboundary movement of GDMMs can be
addressed; and what role might be played by existing multinational bodies and agreements in authori-
zation decisions. Regulation and policies applied for
registration of other genetically modified organisms
or other living mosquito products are assessed for relevance to the use case of GDMMs to prevent malaria
in Africa. Multiple national authorities are likely to
be involved in decision-making, according to existing
laws in place within each country for certain product
classes. Requirements under the Cartagena Protocol
on Biodiversity will be considered relevant in most
countries, as may existing regulatory frameworks
for conventional pesticide, medical, and biocontrol
products. Experience suggests that standard regulatory processes, evidence requirements, and liability
laws differ from country to country. Regional mechanisms will be useful to address some of the important
challenges.
