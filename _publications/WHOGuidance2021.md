This revised version of the Guidance framework for testing of genetically modified mosquitoes, published in 2014, takes into account the technical progress made and lessons learned since then in this rapidly advancing field of research. Like the original Guidance framework, it is intended to provide standards that foster quality and consistency in the processes for developing, testing and regulating these new genetic technologies. Best practices recommended in the 2021 Guidance framework will further contribute to the comparability of results and credibility of conclusions in order to facilitate decision-making by countries interested in the potential use of GMMs as public health tools for the control of vector- borne diseases.
