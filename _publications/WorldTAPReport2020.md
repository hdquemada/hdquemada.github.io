The use of gene-drive constructs in genetically modified insects has great potential to address malaria vector control in Africa and worldwide. However, they can only be developed and deployed if regulatory agencies have the capacity to properly review and make decisions on this new category of applications of genetic modification technology. This policy brief summarizes the results obtained from the needs assessment for regulatory capacity building for gene-drives in Africa.
