I enjoy listening to videos where the musician covers the bass line. It's fascinating to focus on a voice in the music you don't often pay attention to, but would miss if it weren't there. I was listening to two different bass players on YouTube covering Dua Lipa's "Don't Start Now". I combined them in the same video just for fun.
