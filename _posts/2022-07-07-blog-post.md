My wife and I went up north for a couple of days, first to attend a concert last night at Interlochen, and then today to hang around Traverse City. We didn't know it was the Cherry Festival, so the town itself was too busy. But we were really more interested in going up the Old Mission Peninsula, which was much quieter, and which is where we have a lot of good memories of the area.</p>

<p>The view from Lighthouse Point beach on Old Mission Peninsula across the east arm of Grand Traverse Bay. The lake is shallow enough here to walk out a quarter mile and still be waist deep. The kids used to enjoy swimming here.</p>

<p>The lighthouse at Lighthouse Point. It was decommissioned in 1931 and replaced by a floating beacon in the bay. Wonder what happened to the ships trying to navigate these waters during the interim?</p>

<p>We stopped by our favorite winery, Chateau Chantal, where we haven't been for a few years, partly due to the pandemic. Bev tried a white wine flight and an ice wine. I tried the reds: a pinot noir, cabernet franc, and malbec. I didn't like any of them. Too thin and watery, and still tasted rough to me. The white wines were better, especially the ice wine.</p>
  
We arrived home tired, but glad to have spent an enjoyable couple of days.
