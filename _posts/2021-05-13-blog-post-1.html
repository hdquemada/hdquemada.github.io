    <p>Dear Mission Team,<br>
      You had some questions about the payments to International Student Ministry and Young Life College, that I promised to ask Jim. Here is his response. Dianne was correct; we pay the ISL through Classis. My inclination is not to ask for any of the money back that we already sent to Young Life College. I am sure they can use those funds for other purposes.
